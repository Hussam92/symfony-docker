This is the `/articles` endpoint. It is a GET Request and will return you a list of the latest articles. It returns a JSON List

This still needs to be updated to show published Articles

The function `listArticles`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/Controller/ArticlesController.php:12:5:5:`    public function listArticles(): Response`"/> shows all articles. It uses the `Response`<swm-token data-swm-token=":src/Controller/ArticlesController.php:12:10:10:`    public function listArticles(): Response`"/> class as return type.
